## Interests 
I am a physcial oceanographer with special interests in **ocean dynamics and its role in climate**, focusing on air-sea interactions, meso-to-large scales interactions and oceanic chaotic variability. I developped a research strategy with a strong modelling approach (mostly with the MITgcm to date), going from coarse resolution, idealized coupled simulations to realistic, eddy-resolving regional ensemble simulations.
