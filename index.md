## Interests 
I am a physiscal oceanographer with special interests in **large-scale ocean dynamics** and **its role in Climate**. I focus my research on **processes** controlling its balance and its variability on climate time scales with an energetic viewpoint. To this end, I develop an approach based on **numerical modelling** to study the role of small scale processes on ocean climate. I am particularly interested in intrinsic ocean variability, air-sea interactions and cross-scale energy transfers.

## Current affiliation
 - Postdoctoral researcher position at *Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique* ([INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr)) in the [ODYSSEY](https://team.inria.fr/odyssey/) group, funded by the [ERC-STUOD](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/ocean-dynamics-synergy/) project.
