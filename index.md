## Interests 
I am a physcial oceanographer with special interests in **large-scale ocean dynamics**, its major sources and sinks of energy, and processes controlling its balance and its variability on climate time scales. I conduct my research with a modelling approach, taking advantage of the increasing computational power ressources to study the role of small scale processes on ocean climate. I am particularly interested in intrinsic ocean variability, air-sea interactions, cross-scale energy transfers and bottom boundary layers.
