## Interests 
I am a physcial oceanographer with special interests in **ocean dynamics and its role in climate**, focusing on air-sea interactions, meso-to-large scales interactions and oceanic chaotic variability. I conduct my researches with a modelling strategy (mostly with the MITgcm so far), going from coarse resolution, idealized coupled simulations to realistic, eddy-resolving regional ensemble ocean simulations.
