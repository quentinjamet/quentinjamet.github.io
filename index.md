## Interests 
I am a physiscal oceanographer with special interests in **large-scale ocean dynamics** and **its role in Climate**. I focus my research on **processes** controlling its balance and its variability on climate time scales with an energetic viewpoint. To this end, I develop an approach based on **numerical modelling** to study the role of small scale processes on ocean climate. I am particularly interested in intrinsic ocean variability, air-sea interactions, cross-scale energy transfers and stochastic modelling.

## Current affiliation
 - Researcher at *Service hydrographique et oc√©anographique de la marine* ([Shom](https://www.shom.fr/)).
