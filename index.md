## Interests 
I am a physiscal oceanographer with special interests in **large-scale ocean dynamics** and **its role in Climate**. I focus my research on processes controlling its balance and its variability on climate time scales with an energetic viewpoint. To this end, I develop an approach based on numerical modelling, taking advantage of the increasing computational power resources to study the role of small scale processes on ocean climate. I am particularly interested in intrinsic ocean variability, air-sea interactions, cross-scale energy transfers and bottom boundary layer dynamics.

## Current position
 - Postdoctoral researcher at *Institut des Géosciences de l’Environnement* ([IGE](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/)) in the [MEOM](http://meom-group.github.io/) group under the [CONTaCTS](https://meom-group.github.io/projects/contacts/) project
