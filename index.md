## Interests 
I am a physcial oceanographer with special interests in **large-scale ocean dynamics** and **its role in Climate**. I focus my research on processes controlling its balance and its variability on climate time scales with an energetic viewpoint. To this end, I develop an original modelling approach, taking advantage of the increasing computational power ressources to study the role of small scale processes on ocean climate, and thinking ways to include their effects in climate models. I am particularly interested in intrinsic ocean variability, air-sea interactions, cross-scale energy transfers and bottom boundary layers dynamics.
