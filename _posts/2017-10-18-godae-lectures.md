title: "Lectures on ocean modelling for GODAE international school."

I was happy to spend a week in Mallorca (Spain) in early October for [GODAE international school](https://www.godae-oceanview.org/outreach/education-training/gov-summer-school-2017/) on the "New Frontiers in Operational Oceanography". The counterpart for my enjoying the autumn mediteranean sun was to prepare a series of three lectures on the "New frontiers in ocean modelling". 

Preparing this lecture series gave me the opportunity to wrap up some of the concepts and ideas that our [research group](http://meom-group.github.io/) is currently developping in a series of projects. So I figured out this material might be worth sharing with a wider audience.

The slides of the lectures are available on a dedicated [github repository](https://github.com/lesommer/2017-lectures-godae-ocean-view). Please, do not hesitate to reuse this lecture material or to send feedbacks. 

I also take this opportunity for thank again the organizers of GODAE international school who did a great job in setting up a great scientific event (in a great place too!).
